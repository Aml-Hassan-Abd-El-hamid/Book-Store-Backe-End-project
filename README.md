## Task One

Our project is depending on ***NodeJs*** to build a Book Store, Which provides different types of books and make customer able to buy any of them. Each book has its **Name**, **Author** and **Price** as an initial attributes.

In File: [Books.js](https://github.com/Nourelshehry/Book-Store-Backe-End-project/blob/main/models/book.js) you can see the basic set of books which we created.

The Basic functions we used is: ***Get***, ***Post***, ***Delete***, and ***Put*** to make basic proccesses in our BookSet, you can see this here: controller link . With help of **Postman** these functions are applied. Like that:

**Get**


**Delete**


**Post**


**Put**




*Note*
1-The validation function file:(link) is used to validate the rules which we predetermined, we call it in need (e.g.: ***Put*** and ***Post***).
2-The Rouer file: (link)  is used to access all functions when it's called.
